 Implement the function:
 void oddsKeepEvensFlip(int arr[], int arrSize)
 
 This function gets an array of integers arr and its logical size arrSize. When called, it should reorder (in-place) the elements of arr so that:
 1. All the odd numbers come before all the even numbers
 2. The odd numbers will keep their original relative order
 3. The even numbers will be placed in a reversed order (relative to their original order).
 
 For example, if arr = [5, 2, 11, 7, 6, 4],
 after calling oddsKeepEvensFlip(arr, 6), arr will be: [5, 11, 7, 4, 6, 2]
 
 Implementation requirements:
 1. Your function should run in linear time. That is, if there are n items in arr, calling
 oddsKeepEvensFlip(arr, n) will run in 𝜃(𝑛).
 2. Write a main() program that tests this function..
