### What is a function?
    A nonempty set that is maps element of A to an element of B
    
    f: A -> B (function f from A to B, an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A)
    f(a) = b (b is the unique element of B assigned by the function f to the element a of A)
        
        Carlos can get grade A. Sandeep can also get grade A. A student is mapped onto a specific grade. A student cannot get two grades in one class. 
        
### Domain vs. Codomain, Image vs Preimage, Range
    f: A -> B 
    f maps A to B 
    A = Domain of f
    B = Codomain of f

    f(a) = b
    b is the image of a
    a is the preimage of b
    Range of f = set of all images of elements of A
