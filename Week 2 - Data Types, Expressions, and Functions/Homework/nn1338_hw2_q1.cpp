 Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes, nickels and
 pennies and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in the format of dollars and
 remaining cents.
 
 Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
 Please enter number of coins:
 # of quarters: 13
 # of dimes: 4
 # of nickels: 11
 # of pennies: 17
 The total is 4 dollars and 37 cents
