### Process of Executing a Program
    Concept - A byte contains 8 bits in 1 physical address 
    A program is a set of instruction, i.e. 96 bytes here represent a prog.exe (executable application)
    An application is stored in the secondary memory 
    => Gets copied to RAM (main memory) for later on faster execution 
    => CPU then uses a program counter to point at the bytes meant to be executed 
    => runs a fetch, decode, and execute cycle over and over again until the program ends
