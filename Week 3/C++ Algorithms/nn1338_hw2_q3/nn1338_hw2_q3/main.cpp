 Suppose John and Bill worked for some time and we want to calculate the total time both of
 them worked. Write a program that reads number of days, hours, minutes each of them
 worked, and prints the total time both of them worked together as days, hours, minutes.
 
 Hint: Try to adapt the elementary method for addition of numbers to this use.
 Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
 
 Please enter the number of days John has worked: 2
 Please enter the number of hours John has worked: 12
 Please enter the number of minutes John has worked: 15
 
 Please enter the number of days Bill has worked: 3
 Please enter the number of hours Bill has worked: 15
 Please enter the number of minutes Bill has worked: 20
 
 The total time both of them worked together is: 6 days, 3 hours and 35 minutes.
