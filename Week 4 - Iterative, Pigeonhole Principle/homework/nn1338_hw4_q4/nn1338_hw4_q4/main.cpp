 Write two versions of a program that reads a sequence of positive integers from the user,
 calculates their geometric mean, and print the geometric mean.
 Notes:
 1. In mathematics, geometric mean of a dataset {a1, a2, a3 ..., an} containing positive numbers, is given by: the nth root of the set a1*a2*a3...an.
    For example, the geometric mean of 2, 9 and 12 is equal to 6
 2. In order to calculate the n-th root of a number, you should call the pow funciton, located in the cmath library.

 Your two versions should read the integer sequence in two ways:
 a) First read the length of the sequence.
 For example, an execution would look like:
 Please enter the length of the sequence: 3
 Please enter your sequence:
 1
 2
 3
 The geometric mean is: 1.8171
 
 b) Keep reading the numbers until -1 is entered.
 For example, an execution would look like:
 Please enter a non-empty sequence of positive integers, each one in a separate line. End your
 sequence by typing -1:
 1
 2
 3
 -1
 The geometric mean is: 1.8171
