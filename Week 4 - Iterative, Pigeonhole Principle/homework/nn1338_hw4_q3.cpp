/*

 Write a program that reads from the user a positive integer (in a decimal representation), and
 prints its binary (base 2) representation.
 
 Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
 Enter decimal number:
 76
 The binary representation of 76 is 1001100
