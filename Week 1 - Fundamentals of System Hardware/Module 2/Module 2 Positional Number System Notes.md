**Concept**: Memory is made out of bits and are grouped into a byte. Each bit is made with electrical flow or a magnetic field. Abstractly, we represent each bit as zero and one because it only has two states "on or off." Despite having only two states. it can represent a lot of data using this primitive unit. 

### Mapping number to represent symbols, images, audios, videos
    H = 72,
    lowercase e = 101 etc. 
    120 = red
    100 = green
    200 = blue

### Sign and Magnitude

    1 in front of 7 bit = negative (-) integer
    0 in front of 7 bit = positive (+) integer
    
![Sign and Magnitude](https://github.com/Nam-H-Nguyen/NYUTandonBridge2018/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20Fundamentals%20of%20System%20Hardware/Module%202/Note%20Images/sign.png)

    Take the sum between the two to find the opposite values equating to 100000000
