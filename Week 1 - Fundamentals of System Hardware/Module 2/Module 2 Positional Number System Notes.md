**Concept**: Memory is made out of bits and are grouped into a byte. Each bit is made with electrical flow or a magnetic field. Abstractly, we represent each bit as zero and one because it only has two states "on or off." Despite having only two states. it can represent a lot of data using this primitive unit. 

### Mapping number to represent symbols, images, audios, videos
    H = 72,
    lowercase e = 101 etc. 
    120 = red
    100 = green
    200 = blue
    
### Counting in Different Number System
    11 is represented as one group of 10 and one 1.
    100 is represented as ten group of 10's and zero 1's.
