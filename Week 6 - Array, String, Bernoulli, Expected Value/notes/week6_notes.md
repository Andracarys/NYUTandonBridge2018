**Concept**: 

### Array 
    Basic Properties: (Address of arr[i]) = (address arr begins) + i * (size of each element in arr)
    (address of arr[2]) = 1000 + 2 * 4 = 1008

### Array syntax

### Calling by value vs calling by reference
    Calling by value makes a copy of the function value and passes that onto the caller function. The value can be changed within the function scope but does not change the values of the original value. 
    ** Linear runtime (Theta X) + allocate space to make a copy of the data
    Calling by reference allows access to the original data, thus any changes to the value also changes the value of the original data. 
    ** Constant runtime (Theta 1)
    
### String syntax

### Random Variables
    Definition: Random variable assigns a real number to each possible outcome.
        A random variable is a function from a sample space of an experiment. It's not a variable or random!
