 The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. e also arises in the study of compound interest, and in many other applications.
 Background of e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)
 
 e can be calculated as the sum of the infinite series:
 e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + . . .
 
 The value of e is approximately equal to 2.71828. We can get an approximate value of e, by
 calculating only a partial sum of the infinite sum above (the more addends we add, the better approximation
 we get).
 
 Implement the function:
 double eApprox(int n)
 This function is given a positive integer n, and returns an approximation of e, calculated by the
 sum of the first (n+1) addends of the infinite sum above.

 To test your function use the following main:
 int main() {
    cout.precision(30);
    for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
        cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
 }
 
 Notes:
 1. eApprox. An efficient implementation would run in 0(n) = n
 2. Since the values of the factorials will grow to be very large, use a variable of type double to store them.

int main() {
    
    // Testing the value finite (n) for eApprox function
    cout.precision(30);

        cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl;

double eApprox(int n){
    double result, factorial;
    
    result = 1;
    factorial = 1;
    
    for (int count = 1; count <= n; count++) {
        factorial *= count; // Find the factorial by multiplying previous value to the next
        result += 1/factorial; // Add the inverse factorial together to find e natural logarithm
    }
    
    return result;
