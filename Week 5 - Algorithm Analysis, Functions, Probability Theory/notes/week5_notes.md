**Concept**: 

### Primality Testing
    Only divisors are 1 and the num.
    
    k*d = num
    4*25 = 100; 4 and 25 are called complementary divisors

### Runtime Analysis
    Depends on the size of the input
    Compare the number of primitive operations executed by a process, as a function of its input size
        e.g; each primitive operations count as 1

### Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O or Theta)
    Measures the order of growth of the function
    Depends on machine hardware technology

### Probability
    Definition: If S is a finite nonempty sample space of equally likely outcomes, and E is an event, that is, a subset of S, then the probability of E is p(E) = |E| / |S| 
    For every event E, we have 0 <= p(E) <= 1. 
    
    Sample space = set of possible outcomes
    Event = subset of the sample space
