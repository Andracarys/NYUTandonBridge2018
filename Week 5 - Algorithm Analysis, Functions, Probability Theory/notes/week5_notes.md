**Concept**: 

### Primality Testing
    Only divisors are 1 and the num.
    
    k*d = num
    4*25 = 100; 4 and 25 are called complementary divisors

### Runtime Analysis
    Depends on the size of the input
    Compare the number of primitive operations executed by a process, as a function of its input size
        e.g; each primitive operations count as 1

### Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O or Theta)
    Measures the order of growth of the function
    Depends on machine hardware technology
